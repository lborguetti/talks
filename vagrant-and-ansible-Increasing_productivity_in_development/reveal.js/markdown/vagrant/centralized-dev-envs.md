Centralized dev envs
===

- Generates [Snowflake servers](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SnowflakeServer.html)
- No repeatability.
- No rastreability (there is some, but not easy to check).
- Hard to scale (right now it is damn slow).
    - Quota hell.
- Easy to mess (how to co-exist different versions of the same libraries ?)
